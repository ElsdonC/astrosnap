## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

- Developed a web app allowing users to fetch NASA astrology images according to a specific calendar date.
- Implemented media queries for responsiveness across multiple device resolutions.
- Leveraged the capabilities of JavaScript's asynchronous functions.

## Optimizations

Some future tweaks if time allows:
- Implement image preloading  to reduce the delay when users click to view them. This can improve the user experience by making the image loading process feel faster.
- Apply image compression to optimize the loading time by compressing the fetched images before displaying them. This can be particularly helpful for users with slower internet connections.
- Offer support for multiple languages and date formats to cater to a global audience.

## Lessons Learned

I learned how to interact with an external API, how to make HTTP requests, handle responses, and parse the retrieved data. This was possible by learning how to use asynchronous JavaScript functions to handle API requests.
